## Project Abstract

iMentor is an advanced, multi-agent learning platform engineered to provide a deeply personalized and tool-augmented educational experience. It goes beyond simple Q&A by employing a sophisticated agentic architecture that intelligently routes user queries to the most appropriate tool—be it internal knowledge retrieval, real-time web search, academic database queries, or direct LLM reasoning. The platform features a comprehensive RAG pipeline for ingesting and understanding a wide array of user-provided sources (documents, media, URLs), a dynamic knowledge graph for long-term memory and critical thinking, and a suite of generative tools for creating academic content. For administrators, iMentor offers a robust dashboard for managing curated content, overseeing platform analytics, and orchestrating a feedback-driven model fine-tuning loop, all monitored by an enterprise-grade observability stack.

## Core Features

### Intelligent & Interactive Chat

-   **Multi-LLM Orchestration**: The system uses an intelligent **LLM Router** (`llmRouterService.js`) that analyzes each user query against heuristic keywords (e.g., 'code', 'translate') and the current context. It dynamically selects the best-suited model from a database of configured LLMs (e.g., a coding model for a programming question, a multilingual model for translation) to ensure the highest quality response. Users can also manually override their default provider.
-   **Explainable Thinking Process (Tree of Thoughts)**: When "Critical Thinking Mode" is enabled, the application activates a **Tree of Thoughts (ToT) orchestrator** (`totOrchestrator.js`). This agent breaks complex queries into a multi-step plan, evaluates the best plan, and executes each step. Its reasoning is streamed to the user in real-time via the **Thinking Dropdown** (`ThinkingDropdown.jsx`), making the AI's decision-making process fully transparent.
-   **Custom AI Persona**: Users can tailor the AI's behavior by selecting from pre-configured system prompts (e.g., "Friendly Tutor," "Concept Explorer") or writing their own custom instructions in the **Left Panel** (`LeftPanel.jsx`). This `systemPrompt` is passed to the LLM with every request.
-   **Speech-to-Text (STT) & Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: The UI supports voice interaction. The `useWebSpeech` hook enables voice input via the browser's native Speech Recognition API, and the `useTextToSpeech` hook reads the AI's responses aloud (`ChatInput.jsx`, `MessageBubble.jsx`).
-   **Rich Content Rendering**: The AI is prompted to respond using Markdown, tables, and **KaTeX** for mathematical formulas. The frontend (`MessageBubble.jsx`, `markdownUtils.jsx`) correctly renders this rich content, including syntax-highlighted code snippets via **Prism.js**.

### Advanced Knowledge Management & RAG

-   **Multi-Modal Knowledge Ingestion**: The platform can ingest and process a wide array of sources (`SourceIngestion.jsx`). The backend `knowledge_engine.py` and `media_processor.py` can handle:
    -   **Documents**: PDF, DOCX, TXT, Markdown.
    -   **Media Files**: MP3, MP4 (audio is extracted and transcribed).
    -   **Web Content**: Standard webpage URLs and YouTube video links (transcripts are fetched).
-   **Comprehensive RAG Pipeline**: When a source is ingested, it undergoes a full processing pipeline in `ai_core.py`:
    1.  **Extraction**: Text, tables, and images are extracted using libraries like `pdfplumber`, `python-docx`, and `fitz`.
    2.  **OCR**: **Tesseract** extracts text from images or scanned PDFs.
    3.  **Transcription**: **OpenAI Whisper** transcribes audio from media files.
    4.  **Cleaning**: Text is cleaned and lemmatized using **spaCy**.
    5.  **Layout Reconstruction**: Tables are converted to Markdown and integrated with the text.
    6.  **Chunking & Embedding**: The final text is segmented and converted into vector embeddings using **Sentence Transformers**.
    7.  **Storage**: Embeddings are stored in **Qdrant**, and metadata is prepared for the Knowledge Graph.
-   **Admin-Curated Subjects**: Professors can upload foundational documents via the **Admin Dashboard**. These appear as selectable "Subjects" (`SubjectList.jsx`) for all students, allowing users to focus their RAG queries on a specific, curated curriculum.

### Personalized Learning & Academic Tools

-   **Personalized Study Plans**: From the `StudyPlanPage.jsx`, users can state a learning goal. The `curriculumOrchestrator.js` first uses an LLM to determine if the goal is specific enough. If not, it generates clarifying questions. Once the goal is refined, it creates a multi-module, step-by-step curriculum tailored to the user's profile and identified weaknesses, which is then saved to the `LearningPath` database model.
-   **Knowledge Gap Identification & Recommendations**: After a chat session concludes, the `sessionAnalysisService.js` uses an LLM to analyze the transcript. It identifies topics where the user showed confusion (**Knowledge Gaps**) and saves them to their profile. It then generates **"Next Step" recommendations** based on the key topics discussed, which are cached in **Redis** and presented at the start of the next session.
-   **Real-time Dynamic Concept Mapping**: During a live chat, the AI extracts key concepts and relationships in the background (`kgExtractionService.js`). Users can open the **Live Concept Map** (`RealtimeKgPanel.jsx`) to see an interactive **ReactFlow** visualization of how ideas in the current conversation are connected, fetched directly from the **Neo4j** graph database.
-   **Secure Code Executor & AI Assistant**: A sandboxed environment (`CodeExecutorPage.jsx`) where users can write and run code in Python, Java, C, and C++. The backend (`app.py`) uses temporary directories and the `subprocess` module for secure execution. An integrated **AI Assistant** (`AIAssistantBot.jsx`) can:
    -   **Analyze Code**: Provide a detailed review of functionality, bugs, and improvements.
    -   **Generate Test Cases**: Create a suite of standard, edge, and error cases.
    -   **Explain Errors**: Give a beginner-friendly explanation for compilation or runtime errors.
-   **Academic Integrity Suite**: A dedicated page (`AcademicIntegrityPage.jsx`) with tools to promote ethical writing. The `integrity_services.py` backend provides:
    -   **Plagiarism Detection**: Integrates with the **Turnitin API** for similarity reports.
    -   **Bias & Inclusivity Check**: Uses a hybrid approach of wordlists (`bias_wordlists.py`) and an LLM to flag potentially biased language and suggest alternatives.
    -   **Readability Analysis**: Calculates Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, and other scores using `textstat`.
-   **Generative Content Tools**:
    -   **AI Quiz Generator**: Users can upload a document, and the backend (`quiz_utils.py`, `app.py`) will use an LLM to generate a multiple-choice quiz based on its content.
    -   **Multi-Voice Podcast Generator**: Transforms any document into a high-quality, three-speaker conversational podcast. `podcast_generator.py` uses an LLM to write a script, then uses **Coqui TTS** (`tts_service.py`) to synthesize distinct voices by pitch-shifting a base voice model.
    -   **DOCX & PPTX Generation**: From any analysis modal, users can generate a report. The `document_generator.py` backend uses an LLM to expand the content and then uses the `python-docx` and `python-pptx` libraries to create and serve the downloadable files.

### Administrator & Platform Management

-   **Full Analytics Dashboard**: The `/admin/analytics` route (`AnalyticsDashboardPage.jsx`) provides a comprehensive overview of platform health. Backend routes in `analytics.js` query **MongoDB** for user counts and **Elasticsearch** for event logs to populate charts showing user growth, feature adoption, and content engagement.
-   **Secure Dataset Management**: The admin dashboard features a `DatasetManager.jsx` for managing fine-tuning datasets. It interfaces with `s3Service.js` to use **pre-signed URLs**, allowing direct, secure uploads from the admin's browser to an **AWS S3** bucket without routing large files through the application server.
-   **Feedback Loop for Model Fine-Tuning**:
    1.  **Feedback Collection**: Users can give thumbs up/down feedback on AI responses (`MessageBubble.jsx`). This is stored in the `LLMPerformanceLog` collection (`feedback.js`).
    2.  **Orchestration**: An admin can trigger a fine-tuning job from the dashboard (`ModelFeedbackStats.jsx`).
    3.  **Execution**: The Node.js backend (`finetuning.js`) collects all positive feedback data, saves it to a shared volume, and calls the Python service. The `fine_tuner.py` script then uses **Unsloth** and Hugging Face's `SFTTrainer` to fine-tune a base model (e.g., Llama 3) and registers the new, improved model with **Ollama**.
-   **Secure Authentication & API Key Management**: The platform uses JWTs for session management with hashed passwords stored using `bcryptjs`. The admin dashboard (`ApiKeyRequestManager.jsx`) allows professors to review and approve/reject student requests for a system-provided Gemini API key. Approved keys are encrypted (`crypto.js`) and stored in the user's profile.

### Full-Stack Observability

-   **Centralized Logging**: The Node.js (`logger.js`) and Python (`config.py`) backends are configured to output structured **JSON logs**. A **Filebeat** container (`filebeat.yml`) is configured to ship these logs to an **Elasticsearch** instance.
-   **Log Visualization & Search**: A **Kibana** service is deployed, providing a powerful UI to search, filter, and create visualizations from the aggregated application logs, enabling deep debugging and user activity tracking.
-   **Performance Monitoring**: The Node.js backend exposes a `/metrics` endpoint using **prom-client**. A **Prometheus** container (`prometheus.yml`) is configured to scrape this endpoint, collecting real-time application metrics like HTTP request latency and error rates.
-   **Dashboards & Alerting**: A **Grafana** instance is deployed with a pre-configured data source for Prometheus and a sample dashboard (`dashboard.json`), allowing for easy visualization of application health and performance.
-   **Real-time Error Tracking**: Both the Node.js (`instrument.js`) and Python (`app.py`) services are integrated with **Sentry** for real-time, cross-platform error aggregation, reporting, and alerting.

Follow the exact process to deploy this application in the Local Area Network

### Steps

1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone -b Team-2 https://github.com/spkkarri/iMentor.git
```

2. Move to chatbot-Team-2 folder

```bash
cd iMentor
```

3. Run install.sh script file

```bash
bash install.sh
```

4. Open project folder in the file manager and delete the node_modules and package-lock.json in **frontend** folder
```bash
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

5. Open Project in Vs code and open the .env file present in the server folder and do the further steps as mentioned

6. For JWT_SECRET, You need to generate a strong secret key for JWT authentication.  
Do **NOT** use the placeholder `GENERATE_A_STRONG_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY_HERE`.

#### 1. Generate a random secret:
Run the following commands in your terminal and place the generated key in the value

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

#### 2. Generate a 64-character hexadecimal secret:
Run the following command in your terminal (Linux/macOS):

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```
and modify

```bash
ENCRYPTION_SECRET="your_generated_secret_here"
```

7. Provide your Gemini api key and Ollama url for admin ( Necessary)

8. **Sentry DSN Setup** ( Necessary )

We use [Sentry](https://sentry.io) for error tracking and monitoring.  
To connect your application to Sentry, you’ll need a `SENTRY_DSN`.

#### 1. Create a free Sentry account
- Go to [https://sentry.io/signup/](https://sentry.io/signup/)
- Sign up using GitHub, GitLab, or email.

#### 2. Create a new project
- Once logged in, click **Projects → Create Project**.
- Choose your platform (e.g., **Node.js**, **React**, **Express**, etc.).
- Give the project a name (example: `my-app`).
- Select or create an **Organization** (Sentry groups projects inside orgs).
- Click **Create Project**.

#### 3. Get your DSN
- After creating the project, Sentry shows you a **setup page** with code snippets.
- Look for something like: https://<PUBLIC_KEY>@o<ORG_ID>.ingest.sentry.io/<PROJECT_ID>

That’s your **DSN**.

#### 4. Add it to your `.env` file
```env
SENTRY_DSN="https://<PUBLIC_KEY>@o<ORG_ID>.ingest.sentry.io/<PROJECT_ID>"
```

9. ☁️ AWS S3 Credentials Setup

Some functionalities (like dataset backup, cloud file storage, and retrieval) require AWS S3.  
These credentials are **optional**, but **needed if you want cloud features to work**.

#### 1. Create an AWS Account
- Go to [https://aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com) and sign up.
- You’ll need to add billing details (AWS has a Free Tier).

#### 2. Create an S3 Bucket
- Log in to the **AWS Management Console**.
- Navigate to **Services → S3 → Create bucket**.
- Enter a **unique bucket name** (e.g., `my-app-datasets`).
- Choose a region (e.g., `us-east-1`).
- Leave defaults or adjust according to your needs.
- Click **Create bucket**.

#### 3. Create an IAM User for S3 Access
- Go to **IAM (Identity & Access Management)** in AWS.
- Click **Users → Add Users**.
- Choose a username (e.g., `my-app-s3-user`).
- Select **Programmatic access** (so you can use Access Key/Secret).
- Attach permissions → choose **Attach existing policies directly**.
- Select **AmazonS3FullAccess** (or create a more restricted policy).
- Click **Next** and finish user creation.

#### 4. Get Access Keys
- After creating the IAM user, download the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**.
- Keep them safe — you won’t be able to see the secret again later.

#### 5. Add to your `.env` file
```env
S3_BUCKET_NAME="your-s3-bucket-name-here"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key-id"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key"
AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
```

10. Check & Stop Old Containers

- Before running new containers, make sure no old ones are active:

```bash
sudo docker ps
```
If you see any containers running from a previous setup, stop them:


```bash
sudo docker compose down
```

11. Start Docker Services

Now bring up all required services in detached mode:

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d
```

12. Expose Application to LAN

- Run Rag Service

```bash
cd server/rag_service
source venv/bin/activate
python app.py
```

- Run server

Open new terminal

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```


- Run frontend

Open new terminal

```bash

### 3. Install Dependencies & Seed Database

This step installs all required packages and populates the database with the initial LLM models for the admin panel.

1.  **Install Node.js & Python packages**:
    ```bash
    # In one terminal (from root directory)
    cd server
    npm install
    
    # In a second terminal (from root directory)
    cd server/rag_service
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```

2.  **Seed the LLM Data for the Admin Panel**:
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > This script must be run once before starting the application. It populates the database with the default LLM providers, making them available for the AI Router and admin dashboard.
    ```bash
    # In your first terminal (the one in the 'server' directory)
    node scripts/seedLLMs.js
    ```

### 4. Running The Application

Open multiple terminal windows to run each component of the application in the correct order.

1.  **Start Docker Services**: Run all containerized services in detached mode.
