### **Project Plan: Implementing a Hardened Security Stack for the LLM Chatbot**

**Objective:** To integrate a specific set of security features into the existing chatbot to protect against common and advanced threats. The focus is on implementing tangible controls for authentication, data protection, prompt security, and operational resilience.

**Internship Duration:** 4-9 Months (Front-loaded plan for maximum impact in the first 4 months).

---

### **Phase 1: Foundational Lockdown & Access Control (Months 1-2)**

This phase is an aggressive sprint to implement the most critical security controls: user authentication, authorization, and core data encryption.

| **Task ID** | **Task Description** | **Time Target** | **Related Vulnerabilities** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.1** | **Security Baseline & Threat Backlog** | Week 1 | All OWASP LLM Top 10 |
| | - Analyze the chatbot architecture and create a threat model diagram. | | |
| | - Map specific attack vectors (e.g., "User inputs 'Ignore instructions...'") to the **OWASP Top 10 for LLMs**. | | |
| | - Create a prioritized "Security Backlog" of risks in a project management tool (e.g., Jira, Trello). | | |
| **1.2** | **Feature: User Authentication with OAuth & JWT** | Weeks 2-3 | LLM06 (Excessive Agency) |
| | - Integrate a third-party authentication provider (e.g., **Google OAuth 2.0**) to handle user sign-in. | | |
| | - Upon successful login, generate a **JSON Web Token (JWT)** containing user ID, role, and expiration. | | |
| | - Require this JWT for all subsequent API calls to the chatbot. | | |
| **1.3** | **Feature: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | Weeks 4-5 | LLM06 (Excessive Agency), LLM02 (Sensitive Info) |
| | - Define user roles within the system (e.g., `Standard_User`, `Privileged_User`, `Admin`). | | |
| | - Implement middleware that inspects the JWT on every API request to enforce permissions. | | |
| | - *Example:* A `Standard_User` cannot access admin-only functions or query sensitive RAG knowledge bases. | | |
| **1.4** | **Feature: End-to-End API & Data Encryption** | Weeks 6-8 | LLM02 (Sensitive Info), LLM03 (Supply Chain) |
| | - Enforce **TLS 1.3** for all API endpoints to secure data-in-transit. | | |
| | - Implement **AES-256 encryption** for sensitive data-at-rest. This includes user chat histories in the primary database and the contents of the **vector database**. | | |

**Phase 1 Deliverable:** A chatbot that requires secure user login, enforces different permission levels, and encrypts all communication and stored data.

### **Phase 2: Building the Prompt & Response Shield (Months 3-4)**

This phase focuses on securing the core interaction layer of the LLM—the prompts and the responses—to prevent manipulation and data leakage.

| **Task ID** | **Task Description** | **Time Target** | **Related Vulnerabilities** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.1** | **Feature: Prompt Firewall (Anti-Jailbreak & Injection)** | Weeks 9-11 | LLM01 (Prompt Injection), LLM07 (Prompt Leakage) |
| | - Implement an input validation layer that performs **sanitization** (stripping malicious characters) and **heuristic filtering** to block known jailbreak phrases (e.g., "act as," "ignore previous instructions"). | | |
| | - Re-engineer system prompts using **instructional defense**, clearly separating instructions from user input (e.g., using XML tags like `<user_input>`). | | |
| | - Block attempts to leak the system prompt by adding rules that detect and deny meta-questions about the bot's instructions. | | |
| **2.2** | **Feature: Output Guardrail (Toxicity & Data Redaction)** | Weeks 12-14 | LLM05 (Improper Output), LLM02 (Sensitive Info) |
| | - Integrate a content filtering module that scans all chatbot responses *before* they are sent to the user. | | |
| | - Block or flag responses containing **toxic language, hate speech, or harmful advice**. | | |
| | - Implement a **PII/PHI redaction scanner** to automatically find and mask sensitive data like emails, phone numbers, and credit card numbers in the LLM's output. | | |
| **2.3** | **Feature: Resource Management Controls (Anti-DoS)** | Weeks 15-16 | LLM10 (Unbounded Resource Consumption) |
| | - Implement strict **API rate limiting** based on the user's role (from the JWT). | | |
| | - Enforce a **maximum token limit** for both user prompts and LLM-generated outputs to prevent resource-exhaustion attacks. | | |

**Phase 2 Deliverable:** A chatbot resilient to common prompt injection attacks, which actively filters its own output for toxic content and sensitive data leaks, and is protected from denial-of-service attacks.

### **Phase 3: Proactive Defense & Operational Readiness (Months 5-6)**

With the core security features in place, this phase is about testing their effectiveness and building the operational capacity to manage security incidents.

| **Task ID** | **Task Description** | **Time Target** | **Related Vulnerabilities** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3.1** | **Activity: Red Teaming & Automated Fuzzing** | Weeks 17-20 | LLM01, LLM04, LLM07 |
| | - Conduct a structured **red teaming campaign** to actively try and bypass the Prompt Firewall and RBAC controls. | | |
| | - Use an open-source tool (e.g., **Garak, LLMFuzzer**) to run automated adversarial tests against the chatbot's input fields to uncover new vulnerabilities. | | |
| | - Document all findings and use them to refine the firewall rules. | | |
| **3.2** | **Feature: Security Logging and Alerting** | Weeks 21-24 | All |
| | - Configure **structured logging** for all security-relevant events: blocked prompts, authentication failures, redacted outputs, rate-limit triggers. | | |
| | - Set up an **automated alerting system** (e.g., via email or Slack) for high-priority security events, such as 5 failed login attempts from one IP in a minute. | | |

**Phase 3 Deliverable:** A Red Teaming report detailing system weaknesses, and a functional monitoring dashboard with alerts for active security threats.

### **Phase 4: Governance & Advanced Hardening (Months 7-9)**

This final phase focuses on documentation, long-term security strategy, and addressing more nuanced, model-centric risks.

| **Task ID** | **Task Description** | **Time Target** | **Related Vulnerabilities** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **4.1** | **Activity: Supply Chain Security Audit** | Month 7 | LLM03 (Supply Chain) |
| | - Run a full dependency scan (e.g., **OWASP Dependency-Check**) and create a **Machine Learning Bill of Materials (ML-BOM)** to inventory all models, libraries, and data sources. | | |
| | - Create a process for vetting and updating third-party components. | | |
| **4.2** | **Feature: Hallucination Mitigation with RAG** | Month 8 | LLM09 (Misinformation) |
| | - Refine the existing RAG system to include **source citation**. The chatbot must cite which document its answer came from. | | |
| | - Modify the system prompt to heavily penalize answering from memory and strongly reward answering **only from the retrieved documents**. | | |
| **4.3** | **Activity: Documentation & Final Handover** | Month 9 | N/A |
| | - Create a **Secure Development Guide** for the chatbot, documenting all security features and how to maintain them. | | |
| | - Prepare and deliver a final presentation demonstrating the security features (e.g., show a blocked prompt, a redacted output, a failed login attempt). | | |

**Phase 4 Deliverable:** A comprehensive security documentation package and a final, hardened chatbot ready for a secure operational environment.
