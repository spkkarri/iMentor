    "CI/CD: Introduction to Continuous Integration,\nContinuous Delivery and Deployment\nWhat is CI/CD?\n\u0000CI and CD stand for continuous integration and continuous delivery/continuous deployment. In\nvery simple terms, CI is a modern software development practice in which incremental code\nchanges are made frequently and reliably.\n\u0000Automated build and test steps triggered by CI ensure that code changes being merged into the\nrepository are reliable. The code is then delivered quickly and seamlessly as a part of the CD\nprocess. In the software world, the CI/CD pipeline refers to the automation that enables\nincremental code changes from developers’ desktops to be delivered quickly and reliably to\nproduction.\nContinuous Integration\n\u0000 Continuous integration is a DevOps software development practice where\ndevelopers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after\nwhich automated builds and tests are run.\n\u0000 The key goals of continuous integration are to find and address bugs quicker,\nimprove software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release\nnew software updates.\nWhy is Continuous Integration Needed?\n\u0000 In the past, developers on a team might work in isolation for an extended\nperiod of time and only merge their changes to the master branch once their\nwork was completed. This made merging code changes difficult and time-\nconsuming, and also resulted in bugs accumulating for a long time without\ncorrection. These factors made it harder to deliver updates to customers quickly.\nHow does Continuous Integration Work?\n\u0000 With continuous integration, developers frequently commit to a shared\nrepository using a version control system such as Git. Prior to each commit,\ndevelopers may choose to run local unit tests on their code as an extra\nverification\nlayer\nbefore\nintegrating.\nA\ncontinuous\nintegration\nservice\nautomatically builds and runs unit tests on the new code changes to\nimmediately surface any errors.\nHow does Continuous Integration Work?\nContinuous Integration Benefits\n\u0000 Improve Developer Productivity: Continuous integration helps your\nteam be more productive by freeing developers from manual tasks\nand encouraging behaviors that help reduce the number of errors\nand bugs released to customers.\nContinuous Integration Benefits\n\u0000 Find and Address Bugs Quicker: With more frequent testing, your team\ncan discover and address bugs earlier before they grow into larger problems\nlater.\n\u0000 Deliver Updates Faster: Continuous integration helps your team deliver\nupdates to their customers faster and more frequently.\nContinuous Delivery\n\u0000 Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes\nare automatically prepared for a release to production. A pillar of modern\napplication\ndevelopment,\ncontinuous delivery\nexpands upon\ncontinuous\nintegration by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and/or a\nproduction environment after the build stage. When properly implemented,\ndevelopers will always have a deployment-ready build artifact that has passed\nthrough a standardized test process.\nContinuous Delivery\n\u0000Continuous delivery lets developers automate testing beyond just unit tests so they can\nverify application updates across multiple dimensions before deploying to customers.\nThese tests may include UI testing, load testing, integration testing, API reliability\ntesting, etc.\n\u0000Once the code is integrated, build and passes the automated tests, the built is pushed\nto the mock server. This enables the developer to check the application on the\nproduction-like environment and confidently upload it on the actual production\nenvironment — ensuring that the software will work well when it reaches to the\ncustomer.\nContinuous Delivery\n\u0000 The main goal of continuous delivery is to make the application deployment\nseamless, reduce risk and ensure the application will work great in the\nproduction environment.\n\u0000 With CD, the application is always ready to deploy and there is no last-minute\nanxiety or urgency. Even the team can be confident about their codebase and\ncan concentrate on their daily development tasks.\nContinuous Delivery\nBenefits of Continuous Delivery\n\u0000Continuous Delivery makes the application deployment painlessly easier and the team no longer\nhave to spend time on the release.\n\u0000It also reduces the risk of deploying the application with bugs as they are detected early on the\nproduction-like mock environment.\n\u0000Research has shown that CD making the releases easy and efficient reduces the burnout and\nultimately makes the team happier.\n\u0000Releases can be made quicker and more often resulting in faster customer feedback and\nimproving the product.\nContinuous Deployment\n\u0000While Continuous Delivery makes the codebase ready for the deployment, Continuous\nDeployment releases it directly to the production server.\n\u0000Continuous deployment is a practice for application deployment wherein any code commit\npassing the automated testing is automatically released to the production server and made\navailable to the users.\n\u0000This process of deployment is fully automated without any manual intervention — and the build\ncomponents that don’t pass the production pipeline are prevented from deploying on the server.\nContinuous Deployment\n\u0000This kind of automatic deployment works great to ship the new components and features of the\napplication and bug fixes quickly to the customers. Users’ feedback is quick as customers stay in\nthe loop with every update and even the team experiences peace of mind as there is no\npressure of release date. Thus, ultimately developers can focus more on developing the\napplication and see their work go live.\nContinuous Deployment\nBenefits of Continuous Deployment\n\u0000Deliver the new changes to the customers as soon as they are developed.\n\u0000You get an early ROI for the new feature as it is available to the users quickly soon after its\ndevelopment.\n\u0000You get an early ROI for the new feature as it is available to the users quickly soon after its\ndevelopment.\n\u0000There is an incremental improvement in quality in a shorter period of time instead of quarterly\nor yearly improvements\nMetrics to track CICD practices\n\u0000The primary goal of any DevOps practice revolve around three aspects: Time, Quality and\nSpeed. Based on the aforementioned factors, the metrics can be grouped as follows:\n\u0000 Time-based metrics\n\u0000 Quality metrics\n\u0000 Automation metrics\nTime-based metrics\n\u0000One of the main objectives of DevOps is to save time and ship code as fast as possible. Hence,\nevaluating the performance of a CI/CD initiative predominantly revolves around measuring the\ntime taken for each of the activities involved. Given below is a list of the common time-based\nmetrics that organizations measure:\n•\n Time to market (TTM)\n•\n Defect resolution time\n•\n “Code freeze-to-delivery” time\n•\n Deployment time\nTime to Market(TTM)\n\u0000This defines the duration between the ideation of a feature and the “go-live” of the same. Your CI/CD\nefforts should significantly shrink the time taken to launch a feature to your customers. While\ntraditional software delivery takes 3-6 months for every internal software release, continuous delivery\ncan foster multiple releases weekly or daily.\n\u0000It is therefore essential to keep a close watch on the time taken to release a feature to the customer\nand if the continuous integration and continuous delivery principles have helped you shrink TTM.\n\u0000If there’s no improvement, the reason could be the technologies you have employed, the workload of\nthe developers, the complexity of the feature. You should retrospect to see where the issue is and fix it\nto increase the speed of your CI/CD pipeline.\nDefect resolution time\n\u0000Defect resolution time or the lifetime of a defect defines the time taken to resolve an issue,\nraised after the code has been delivered or deployed. The time taken to resolve a defect can\nsignificantly impact your customer churn rate. The longer it takes to resolve an issue, the higher\nyour churn rate will be. So, if the defect resolution loop is lengthy despite the implementation of\nyour DevOps practices, there must be some process gaps that you need to identify and fix\nimmediately.\n“Code freeze-to-delivery” time\n\u0000This defines the duration between the code freeze in the team and the delivery of the code.\nContinuous integration shortens this time frame. If it does not, you need to understand why and\nfine-tune your practices to achieve the desired result.\nDeployment time\n\u0000Since CI/CD practices involve a lot of automation, the code deployment should\nhappen at the click of a button. If your team takes an hour or so for deployment,\nthe process is at the peak of inefficiency. Tracking this metric helps you increase\nthe frequency of deployment by eliminating the bottlenecks that hamper the\nspeed of the pipeline.\nQuality Metrics\n\u0000Tracking quality metrics is invariably the most important aspect of DevOps. You might be\nshipping your code at your own pace. However, the last thing you would want to do is to\ncompromise on the quality of your code. It is therefore pivotal to keep a check on how you are\ndoing on quality. The quality metrics that organizations track include, but are not limited to:\n• Test pass rate\n• Number of bugs\n• Defect escape rate\nTest pass rate\n\u0000The test pass rate gives you a clear picture of the quality of your product, based on the\npercentage of passed test cases. It can be calculated by dividing the number of passed test cases\nwith the total number of executed test cases. This metric also helps you understand how well\nyour automated tests work and how often code changes are causing your tests to break.\nContinuous integration and continuous delivery cannot be done without automated testing.\nNumber of bugs\n\u0000This metric is crucial for your continuous deployment efforts because shipping a buggy code\nfaster will only deliver more bugs to your customers, causing intricate problems later on. Hence,\nit is essential to regularly monitor the number of bugs and scrutinize the root cause in case of a\nspike. With a buggy code in the system, none of the DevOps initiatives will yield the results that\nit should.\nDefect escape rate\n\u0000The defect escape rate defines the percentage of defects found in pre-production testing versus in\nproduction. Tracking how many defects make it to production is a great way to evaluate the overall\nquality of the software releases that you do. If you are finding too many issues in production, then you\nknow that you’re not doing a good job of automated testing, QA, etc. Therefore, you have to improve\nyour testing practices and try moving faster again. Your defect escape rate is a great constant feedback\nloop to assess how your team performs.\n\u0000In essence, the defect escape rate serves as a valuable feedback loop, guiding your team in refining their\ntesting practices and maintaining a balance between speed and quality in software development.\nAutomation metrics\n\u0000Since DevOps relies heavily on automation, it is crucial to understand what impact it has created,\nwhen it comes to your deployment process. Given below are some of the metrics that will help\nyou quantify your automation efforts while trying to identify if there is a scope for improvement:\n•\nDeployment size per pipeline\n•\nDeployment frequency\n•\nFailed Deployments\nDeployment size per pipeline\n\u0000 This metric measures the size or complexity of deployments pushed\nthrough each pipeline. It helps in understanding how much automation is\nhandling in each deployment cycle. Smaller deployment sizes generally\nindicate more frequent, incremental updates, which are typically easier to\nmanage and less risky. Larger deployments might signify less frequent\nreleases, potentially increasing the risk of failures and making rollbacks\nmore complex.\nDeployment frequency\n\u0000This metric tracks how often deployments are pushed through the pipeline. Higher\ndeployment frequency often indicates more streamlined and automated processes. It\nimplies that the team is capable of delivering changes quickly and efficiently, which is a\nkey aspect of DevOps. It's important to balance frequency with stability – while more\nfrequent deployments are generally desirable, they shouldn't compromise the reliability\nof the system.\nDeployment frequency\n\u0000This metric tracks how often deployments are pushed through the pipeline.
