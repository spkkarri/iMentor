This architecture fuses advanced language understanding with robust knowledge management and autonomous agentic capabilities.

**A. Hybrid LLM and Knowledge Graph (KG) Fusion**

*   **Rationale:** To combine the conversational prowess of LLMs (like ChatGPT) with the source-grounded, interactive, and potentially code-centric environment inspired by NotebookLM. This is an *architectural integration of functional strengths*, not a merging of model weights.
*   **LLM Core:** A powerful LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Llama 3, or future equivalents via API or self-hosted) will serve as the primary conversational interface and reasoning engine.
*   **Knowledge Graph (KG) for Grounding:**
    *   Academic knowledge is specialized and requires high precision. KGs are crucial for grounding LLM outputs in verified facts, reducing hallucinations, and improving reliability to a "professor" level.
    *   KGs unify structured (metadata databases) and unstructured (research papers) data, creating a rich semantic web.
    *   **Knowledge Graph RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):** This advanced RAG approach retrieves from a fully-grounded KG, providing the LLM with highly relevant, verified, and semantically connected information.
    *   Domain-specific ontologies from the KG can be used for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of the LLM to improve accuracy and lower hallucination frequency.

**B. Agentic AI Framework & Multi-Agent System**

*   **Agentic Principles:** The system will operate with a degree of autonomy, enabling planning, tool use, multimodal understanding, and persistent memory to achieve goals with minimal human input.
*   **Core Agentic Components:**
    *   **Agent/Brain:** The central LLM(s) for understanding, reasoning, and orchestrating actions.
    *   **Planning:** Decomposing complex tasks into sub-tasks (e.g., using Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts).
    *   **Memory Systems:**
        *   **Short-term (Contextual):** For maintaining dialogue coherence.
        *   **Long-term (Semantic/Persistent):** Implemented via RAG from vector databases and the KG for recalling past interactions and learned knowledge.
    *   **Tool Use:** Enabling the LLM to interact with external systems and execute actions (e.g., web search, code execution, API calls).
    *   **Orchestration Layer:** Manages state, workflow, error handling, and communication among agents.
*   **Multi-Agent Architecture:**
    *   Complicated problems will be divided among specialized agents (e.g., Research Agent, Document Generation Agent, Python Code Agent, Visualization Agent).
    *   A **supervisor-based architecture** can coordinate these specialized agents, using tool-calling capabilities to invoke the appropriate agent.
    *   **Frameworks:** LangChain, Microsoft AutoGen, CrewAI, or LangGraph can be used to build and manage these agents and their interactions.

**C. Domain-Specific Fine-tuning**

*   **Necessity:** To imbue the LLM with a deep understanding of engineering and academic contexts, terminology, and nuances.
*   **Techniques:**
    *   **Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT):** Using labeled, domain-specific data (e.g., engineering textbooks, research papers, problem solutions).
    *   **Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT):** Updating a small subset of parameters, making it computationally efficient. Can leverage KG ontologies as input.
*   **Data:** Requires high-quality, relevant data representing engineering language, concepts, and academic practices.

**IV. Data and Knowledge Management for Deep Research**

    *   Clear policies (quality, security, privacy, ethics).
    *   Data quality standards and data catalogs.
    *   Granular user access management.
    *   Regular training and awareness for staff.
    *   AI for data security (audits, threat detection).
    *   Continuous compliance monitoring and independent audits.
    *   Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) for high-risk AI.
